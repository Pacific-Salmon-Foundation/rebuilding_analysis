Adipose clipped fish found in this river are assumed to be Green River stock from the US as no adipose clipped fish are applied to Boundary Bay chinook. All fish are trapped at the fence and are checked for marks and counted through. The only times that fish are missed is during high water events and chinook can possibly swim over the fence. Adipose clipped fish are not used for brood as they are assumed to be Green River. 2010 was the first year that adipose fin clipped fish showed up in the LCR. pNOB was estimated as the total of non clipped fish divided by the sum of non clipped fish and pelvic fin clipped fish. For 2010 onward, pHOS was calculated the total number of marked fish (adipose clipped and pelvic clipped) divided by the total escapement. Fish are selected for brood randomly (ventral clips and non clipped fish) except for making a point to collect jacks representative of the entire population by percentage.

The estimates were populated in the CWT cells out of convenience. The hatchery fish had alternating ventral clips by brood year up to and including the 2015 brood year. Adipose clipped fish found in this river are assumed to be Green River stock from the US as no adipose clipped fish are applied to Boundary Bay chinook. All fish are trapped at the fence and are checked for marks and counted through. The only times that fish are missed is during high water events and chinook can possibly swim over the fence. Adipose clipped fish are not used for brood as they are assumed to be Green River. Fish are selected for brood randomly  except for making a point to collect jacks representative of the entire population by percentage. The random sampling description was provided by Bob Schaefer (Community Advisor, DFO). For our purposes, this was also assumed to be the case historically.",1990-2018,,
